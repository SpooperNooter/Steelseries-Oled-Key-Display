# Steelseries-Oled-Key-Display
(wip) Very rough program to display pressed keystrokes on one of steelseries apex keyboards, does also have a afk animation to help prevent screen burn in. (Default afk time set to 30 secs, can change that in code)

Should support any 128x40 OLED screen on a Steelseries Apex Keyboard (I've only tested it on my Apex 7)

To run, clone or download this repo, install Python 3.8, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run `Oled_app.py`
